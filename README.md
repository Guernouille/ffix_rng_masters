RNG Masters is a tool that allows you to manipulate the RNG in Tetra Masters, the mini-game of Final Fantasy 9.

Always wanted to reach the max score in Tetra Masters, unable to get a specific set of arrows, or trying to get X cards directly ? This tool might help you !

RNG Masters displays the next cards you will obtain (including the ones given out by Doctor Tot in Disc 3), with their stats and arrows. It also displays the board on which you will play your next game of Tetra Masters, in case that helps.

Coded in C++ with Qt.

There are two requirements to use this tool:

    You didn't play a game of Tetra Master since you last powered on your console
    Avoid Memoria on the World Map and the falls in front of Alexandria, it re-rolls the Tetra Masters PRNG

Simply enter how many cards you obtained since your last reset, and how many times you loaded the World Map, in order.
